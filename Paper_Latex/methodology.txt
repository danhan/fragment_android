1. Extract data: We converted the XML dump of bug reports into SQL
database. We extracted all the bug reports of HTC and Motorola from
the SQL database using regular expressions,
e.g. '%[^0-9a-z]HTC[^0-9a-z]%' and '%[^0-9a-z]motorola[^0-9a-z]%'. We
also removed the declined and duplicated bug reports.

2. Where are the labels coming from: Before labeling all the bug
reports, we studied the Android operating system to get the features
of Android phones
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_operating_system] and popular
applications in Android Market
[https://play.google.com/store/apps]. We also studied the hardware
components of HTC and Motorola
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_Android_devices]. The
labels are based on these three aspects of Android phones.

3. Label the bug reports: Zhang and Fan labeled 248 HTC bug reports in
2009 separately and then compared the results by each bug to ensure
the same interpretation of the labels from last step. Then Zhang and
Fan labeled the rest of the bug reports separately.

4. Apply Labeled LDA:We applied the Labeled-LDA tool, Stanford Topic
Modeling Toobox [http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/tmt/tmt-0.4/], to
get the topic-document distribution on our labeled bug reports.

5. Calculate the average relevance of each label: The average relevance over time of each label is calculated for each vendor. For each label the average relevance in one month is the the sum of bug reports' relevance divided by the number of bug reports in this month. The plot of the average relevance of each label between HTC and Motorola is based on this calculation.

6. Apply LDA: We applied LDA on HTC and Motorola bug reports. We tried a set of number of topics for both vendors and in each case we tried to label all the topics generated by LDA based on the manual labels. 

7. Choose the number of topics in LDA: We chose the number of topics in LDA based the rules that the topics are distinct enough from each other, have no repetition and can be well interpreted by us (i.e. we can use the manual labels to tag them).

8. Comparison of LDA and Labeled LDA: For each pair of topics in LDA and Labeled LDA, we computed the their similarity based on the topic-document distribution. That is the Jaccard similarity of the two sets. One is from LDA and the other one is from Labeled LDA. Each set is the bug reports that have relevance to that label. We chose several thresholds on the relevance. That is if the relevance is under the threshold, this bug report is not related to that label. At last we chose threshold to be 0.2 the mean of the similarities is the biggest. 

9. Similarity plot: We arranged the labels from Labeled LDA to be the same order in LDA so that we can focus on the diagonal similarities.  

10. Chi square test: We did chi square test on the distribution of number of bug reports of same labels in LDA and Labeled LDA. Both of the p value of HTC and Motorola bug reports are close to 0.
